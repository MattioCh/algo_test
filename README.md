# algo_test
## 2/Jan:
- algogene runtime is too long
  - difficult to operate and research strategy
  - cannot fetch all the data to try out in Jupyter
- backtrader (python module) is a possible choice
  - can linked to interactive broker straight away
  - language is messy though it is frequently maintained
- zipline is still possibly the best
  - maintained by quantopian, used to be the largest backtesting website
  - problem: difficult to stream data
- Quantconnect:
  - great resources but costly, take time to run
  - can paper trade
## 3/Jan
- Testing out Zipline
  - Have to run on python 3.6
  - conda create -n "your-name" python=3.6
  - conda activate, blah, blah, blah..
  - ipython kernel install --name "the name you want" --user
  - still haven't figured out how to source bundle easily
  - try downloading all the stock data from yahoo finance
    - fail, too low RAM on laptop
    - tried on google collab crash again
    - dont' use this list of stock name from this page "https://investexcel.net/all-yahoo-finance-stock-tickers/"
  - major problem today:
    - too many stock exchange, don't know what data to target
      - many companies are very small, and they are still listed, but have ZERO value
      - These companies are most prevalent in PKL(Pink Sheet) not publicly listed on stock exchange
    - tried quantconnect to scrap largest trading volume stock but the coarse universe doesn't allow scarping down name
    - better way -> best scenario is to find the UNION of data of IBKR and Yahoo finance
